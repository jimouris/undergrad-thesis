### Doop-Soot: Parallel Fact Generation
##### Undergraduate Thesis


###### Abstract:
The use of deductive databases for declarative program analysis has become increasingly popular in recent years. A typical example is Datalog databases. Generating the initial data that is kept in the database is often as expensive as the program analysis itself and does not scale well as the program size increases.

In this thesis we present a parallel approach of the fact-generation process from Java bytecode in order to perform pointer, or points-to analysis in Java programs using the Doop framework. Our goal is to evaluate the benefits of a parallel implementation compared to the non-parallel one.
